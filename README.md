# spring-mvc-testing-example
Meant to be a good example of a tested Spring MVC project for beginners.   There is so much missing from most tutorials.

# How-To
1. Using Maven, run 'maven clean install' to build the .war file.
2. Then, place the .war in your Tomcat webapps dir.
3. Navigate locally to http://localhost:8080/
